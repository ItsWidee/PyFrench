# PyFrench

PyFrench is the project to create a programming language based on the Python's syntax that uses French instead of the common English. 

## But Why ?

PyFrench is not intended to be used as a normal programming language. It is created for educational purpose. Indeed, the goal of PyFrench (PyF) is to be used by schools, students, etc... that have difficulties with English. PyF is a way to learn the syntax of a common programming language, but using French !

## Progress

The creation hasn't start yet. I'm still thinking on how to do it !

## Technologies

We'll use Python to create PyFrench !
